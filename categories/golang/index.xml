      <description>The internet was invented by Vint Cerf.
But it was made usable by Marc Andreeson. And what he did was simple:
He turned it into a VCR.
Now, it seems deeply ironic to me that most of the folks reading this post have probably never used a VCR, although they&amp;rsquo;ve most certainly used the Back, Forward, Stop and Play buttons on a web browser.
It was a powerful metaphor, and it made it possible for nearly half of the world&amp;rsquo;s population to grapple with the experience of traversing a directed, cyclic graph.</description>

      <title>The Dead Pool Pledge</title>

      <description>I love PaaS. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to great lengths to figure out a way to build applications using ONLY SaaS and PaaS platforms. I managed this with a mix of wercker, github, orchestrate.io and pivotal web services.
But with the commitment to any third-party platform, comes a certain kind of fear.
I&amp;rsquo;m a believer in open source. And I&amp;rsquo;m ALSO a believer in commercial software. As much as I believe in the rights and freedoms of the user, I also value the rights and freedoms of the developer - to license his or her work in the way that they see fit.</description>

      <title>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Static) Web</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an early fan of the Baked, Not Fried  concept behind static web generators. But somehow, getting all the tools in place to run one myself seemed onerous. A simple apt-get install mysql was always easier than the vaguely-mystical incantations required to get jekyll up and running.
Then again, there was my deep-seated prejudice against Ruby. (See my previous trolling of the ruby community when I accused them of being singlehandedly responsible for Global Warming.</description>
