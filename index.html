        How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Static) Web
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 4, 2014</span>

    <p>I&rsquo;m an early fan of the <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404">Baked, Not Fried </a>
concept behind static web generators. But somehow, getting all the tools in place
to run one myself seemed onerous. A simple <code>apt-get install mysql</code> was always
easier than the vaguely-mystical incantations required to get jekyll up and running.</p>

<p>Then again, there was my deep-seated prejudice against Ruby. (See my previous
    trolling of the ruby community when I accused them of being singlehandedly
    responsible for Global Warming.)</p>

<p>But with the emergence of <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com">Hugo</a>, an elegant static site
generator written in #Golang, I&rsquo;ve been able to get over the line. Or maybe it
was simply time that I had a blog again.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Joshua McKenty</h1>

<p>I work on both open source and commercial software. I can probably attribute
this socialist/capitalist mix to my dual American/Canadian citizenship,
but I&rsquo;m not <em>that</em> fond of introspection.</p>

<p>I am a cofounder of <a href="http://www.openstack.org">OpenStack</a>.</p>

<p>The longer stories have been told repeatedly, but suffice it to say that some mix
of Jesse Andrews, Chris C. Kemp, Devin Carlen, Vishvananda Ishaya, Soo Choi,
Andy Smith, Manesh Singh and myself ought to be held responsible for the release of
&ldquo;nova&rdquo;, while we were all affiliated with the NASA Ames Research Center.</p>

<p>I am the cofounder of <a href="http://www.pistoncloud.com">Piston Cloud Computing, Inc.</a>,
the first commercial provider of a supported OpenStack software product.</p>

<p>In prior lives, I worked on the <a href="http://sillydog.org/narchive/ns8.php">Netscape Browser</a>,
and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(web_browser">Flock Browser</a>.</p>

<p>I had a brief stint at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapulous">Tapulous</a>,
right around the time of the Apple iPhone App Store launch.</p>

<p>I also founded BountyUp, Natel Canada and BuyLatr, none of which had terribly notable exits.</p>

<p>Most of my open source work is available online on <a href="http://github.com/joshuamckenty">github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Governance</h2>

<p>I currently sit as an elected Gold Member director on the OpenStack Foundation
Board of Directors. In that capacity, I am the co-chair of the
<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/DefCoreCommittee">DefCore committee</a>
 (along with <a href="http://robhirschfeld.com/">Rob Hirschfeld</a>). I was also the founding chair of the (now-defunct)
 <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/TransparencyCommittee">Transparency Working Group</a>.</p>

<p>I am an appointed member of the
<a href="http://cloudfoundry.org/about/index.html">Cloud Foundry Advisory Board</a>.</p>

<p>I am also an appointed member of the
<a href="http://opencontrail.org/opencontrail-advisory-board/">Open Contrail Advisory Board</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Social Media</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jmckenty">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuamckenty">LinkedIn</a></li>
<li><a href="http://about.me/jmckenty">About.me</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t blog all that often.</p>
