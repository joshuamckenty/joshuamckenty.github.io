  The internet was invented by Vint Cerf.
But it was made usable by Marc Andreeson. And what he did was simple:
He turned it into a VCR.
Now, it seems deeply ironic to me that most of the folks reading this post have probably never used a VCR, although they&rsquo;ve most certainly used the Back, Forward, Stop and Play buttons on a web browser.
It was a powerful metaphor, and it made it possible for nearly half of the world&rsquo;s population to grapple with the experience of traversing a directed, cyclic graph.

  I love PaaS. Recently I&rsquo;ve gone to great lengths to figure out a way to build applications using ONLY SaaS and PaaS platforms. I managed this with a mix of wercker, github, orchestrate.io and pivotal web services.
But with the commitment to any third-party platform, comes a certain kind of fear.
I&rsquo;m a believer in open source. And I&rsquo;m ALSO a believer in commercial software. As much as I believe in the rights and freedoms of the user, I also value the rights and freedoms of the developer - to license his or her work in the way that they see fit.

  Projects Most of my projects fall within a few main themes:
OpenStack  OpenStack.org : If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, you should be. Piston OpenStack : Turn-key OpenStack using math and magic. ElkStack.org : Monitoring openstack for fun and profit. RefStack.org : Interoperability tools for the DefCore committee.  Browser Things  ElderBrowser.com : Like reading glasses for the web.  Social Infrastructure  HasTwoParents.com : An email tool for parents.

  <time datetime="2014-08-04T19:22:29Z" class="post-date">Mon, Aug 4, 2014</time>
  I&rsquo;m an early fan of the Baked, Not Fried  concept behind static web generators. But somehow, getting all the tools in place to run one myself seemed onerous. A simple apt-get install mysql was always easier than the vaguely-mystical incantations required to get jekyll up and running.
Then again, there was my deep-seated prejudice against Ruby. (See my previous trolling of the ruby community when I accused them of being singlehandedly responsible for Global Warming.

  Joshua McKenty I work on both open source and commercial software. I can probably attribute this socialist/capitalist mix to my dual American/Canadian citizenship, but I&rsquo;m not that fond of introspection.
I am a cofounder of OpenStack.
The longer stories have been told repeatedly, but suffice it to say that some mix of Jesse Andrews, Chris C. Kemp, Devin Carlen, Vishvananda Ishaya, Soo Choi, Andy Smith, Manesh Singh and myself ought to be held responsible for the release of &ldquo;nova&rdquo;, while we were all affiliated with the NASA Ames Research Center.
