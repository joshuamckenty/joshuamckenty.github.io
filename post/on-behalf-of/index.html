  <h1>On Behalf Of</h1>
  

  <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 17, 2015 </span>
      

<p>The internet was invented by Vint Cerf.</p>

<p>But it was made usable by Marc Andreeson. And what he did was simple:</p>

<p>He turned it into a VCR.</p>

<p>Now, it seems deeply ironic to me that most of the folks reading this post have
probably never used a VCR, although they&rsquo;ve most certainly used the Back, Forward,
Stop and Play buttons on a web browser.</p>

<p>It was a powerful metaphor, and it made it possible for nearly half of the world&rsquo;s
population to grapple with the experience of traversing a directed, cyclic graph.</p>

<p>And in much the same way that we floundered in the world of Gopher and Finger
protocols before Marc&rsquo;s insight of metaphor, we&rsquo;re floundering in the early world
of IoT.</p>

<p>We need a metaphor. And it needs to encapsulate a deceptively difficult concept:
 - Agency.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Understanding Agency</h2>

<p>My refrigerator may someday be able to detect when the cream has gone bad, and
order more - either from Amazon, or from some local grocery store delivery.</p>

<p>Quite literally, my fridge will be acting on my behalf - an agent, if you will.</p>

<p>It will authenticate itself with my home wifi network.</p>

<p>And again with the grocery service, with a payment provider, and possibly with
an independent shipping or delivery service.</p>

<p>Likely, though, the software that actually <em>orders</em> the milk, won&rsquo;t be running
on my fridge. Instead, it will be cloud-based, and acting <em>on behalf of</em> my fridge,
which is in turn acting on behalf of myself.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">In Search of a Metaphor</h2>

<p>When I was young, I worked as an apprentice carpenter. Often, this included errands
to the local hardware or lumber supply store. And usually, I was equipped for these
errands with my boss&rsquo;s credit card (as well as his truck).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, proffering someone else&rsquo;s credit card (and signing for it) is
illegal, much the same as sharing the password or pin to your bank account. And yet,
the image of a household robot, with an empty milk jug in one mechanical hand and
a credit card in the other, is the best metaphor for delegated authentication that
I can come up with. And it&rsquo;s simply not good enough.</p>
