# Projects

Most of my projects fall within a few main themes:

## OpenStack

 - [OpenStack.org](http://openstack.org) : If you're not familiar with it, you should be.
 - [Piston OpenStack](http://www.pistoncloud.com) : Turn-key OpenStack using math and magic.
 - [ElkStack.org](http://elkstack.org) : Monitoring openstack for fun and profit.
 - [RefStack.org](http://refstack.org) : Interoperability tools for the DefCore committee.

## Browser Things

 - [ElderBrowser.com](http://elderbrowser.com) : Like reading glasses for the web.

## Social Infrastructure

 - [HasTwoParents.com](http://hastwoparents.com) : An email tool for parents.
 - [Minipact.com](http://minipact.com) : API-first social infra for promises.
 - [ZeroNetPositive.org](http://blog.zeronetpositive.org/) : Rethinking corporate structures with friends.

## Miscellaneous

 - Build packs for Cloud Foundry and steps for Wercker.
 - [AfterStack.com](http://afterstack.com) : Haven't decided what this is yet ;)

## Defunct Projects

 - BountyUp.com : Like Kickstarter, but 5 years too early. Frozen by the SEC.
 - BuyLatr.com : Browser plugin for price change notifications. Sold it.
 - PatchMe.in : Never miss a conference call or dial a stupid conf ID again.
