I'm an early fan of the [Baked, Not Fried ](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404)
concept behind static web generators. But somehow, getting all the tools in place
to run one myself seemed onerous. A simple ```apt-get install mysql``` was always
easier than the vaguely-mystical incantations required to get jekyll up and running.

Then again, there was my deep-seated prejudice against Ruby. (See my previous
    trolling of the ruby community when I accused them of being singlehandedly
    responsible for Global Warming.)

But with the emergence of [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com), an elegant static site
generator written in #Golang, I've been able to get over the line. Or maybe it
was simply time that I had a blog again.
