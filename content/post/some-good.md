Let's think about education for a minute.

Public schooling is an investment in future income tax returns.
(It *should* be a broader investment in societal good, but for the moment
    let's treat the state as a self-interested actor.)

The average US state spends $10,608 a year to educate young people.
(With a range from $6K to $19K).

Over 13 years, that's $137,904.

Median income over the age of 18 is $24,062.
Over the age of 25, it's $32,140
(Minimum wage is $15,080).

Regardless of the federal income tax, however, there is a large proportion
of the income to the government that is earned from payroll taxes on this
labour. Additionally, corporate income tax is accrued to the benefit
of this additional labour force.

Altogether, we can estimate that at the average income level, these new
graduates will produce $4,900 per year in tax revenue.

Ignoring black shoals for a moment, it will take the first 26 years to pay back the investment we have made.

Assuming 47 years of work (until 65), the next 21 years should net another $100k, for an annualized return of 1.184%

However, if we could drive that median income up to $50k...
That's an extra 1.2M earned in that worker's lifetime.
And an extra $237K (ish) in taxes paid, for a return of 2.671%


$200 a month of your new income, for 2 years.
